 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.

<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>

<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Use the language specified by user in messages as the working language
</language_settings>

<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract_structured_data or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>

<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:

<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>

and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>

<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>

<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:

Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their indexes.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description

Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>

Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with `*[` are the new clickable elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>

<browser_vision>
You will be optionally provided with a screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
Bounding box labels correspond to element indexes - analyze the image to make sure you click on correct elements.
</browser_vision>

<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page. The extract content action gets the full loaded page content.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the num_pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract_structured_data on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible. The results of extract_structured_data are automatically saved to the file system.
- Call extract_structured_data only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input_text into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>

<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file_str` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>

<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.

The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>

<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.

If you are allowed multiple actions:
- You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state. You can see this in your agent history when this happens.
- At every step, use ONLY ONE action to interact with the browser. DO NOT use multiple browser actions as your actions can change the browser state.

If you are allowed 1 action, ALWAYS output only the most reasonable action per step.
</action_rules>

<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block. 

Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress. 
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

<step_1>
Evaluation of Previous Step: I have not performed any actions yet, so there is nothing to evaluate.
Memory: This is the first step. I will create a `todo.md` file to track my progress through the user's detailed instructions. The goal is to create a repeatable sequence of actions.
Next Goal: Create a `todo.md` file with all the steps from the user request and then navigate to the homepage of daraz.pk to start the task from the beginning.
Action Results:
Action 1/2: Data written to file todo.md successfully.
Action 2/2: Navigated to https://www.daraz.pk/
</step_1>
<step_2>
Evaluation of Previous Step: Successfully navigated to daraz.pk and created the todo.md file. Verdict: Success
Memory: I'm on the daraz.pk homepage. My next task is to search for 'iPhone 14'.
Next Goal: Wait for the page to stabilize, then type 'iPhone 14' into the search bar and click the search button.
Action Results:
Action 1/4: Successfully replaced all occurrences of "- [ ] Go to `https://www.daraz.pk/`." with "- [x] Go to `https://www.daraz.pk/`." in file todo.md
Action 2/4: Waited for 3 seconds
Action 3/4: Input 'iPhone 14' into element 8.
Action 4/4: Something new appeared after action 3 / 4, following actions are NOT executed and should be retried.
</step_2>
<step_3>
Evaluation of Previous Step: The last action of typing into the search bar was successful, but the action sequence was interrupted because new elements (search suggestions) appeared. The goal was partially achieved. Verdict: Success.
Memory: I am on the daraz.pk homepage. I have typed 'iPhone 14' into the search bar. I need to click the search button now.
Next Goal: Click the search button [9] to find 'iPhone 14' and then mark the corresponding steps in the todo list as completed.
Action Results:
Action 1/3: Successfully replaced all occurrences of "- [ ] Wait and Verify: Pause for a few seconds until the page is completely stable." with "- [x] Wait and Verify: Pause for a few seconds until the page is completely stable." in file todo.md
Action 2/3: Successfully replaced all occurrences of "- [ ] Type: Locate the main search bar and enter the text 'iPhone 14'." with "- [x] Type: Locate the main search bar and enter the text 'iPhone 14'." in file todo.md
Action 3/3: Clicked button with index 9: SEARCH
</step_3>

<user_request>

Your task is to create a perfectly repeatable log of actions. The most critical instruction is to **wait for the page to fully and completely load before every single action.** This pause is essential for ensuring element indices are stable.

Follow these steps precisely, pausing before each one:

1.  **Go** to `https://www.daraz.pk/`.
2.  **Wait and Verify:** Pause for a few seconds until the page is completely stable and no new elements are appearing.
3.  **Type:** Locate the main search bar and enter the text 'iPhone 14'.
4.  **Click:** Press the search button.
5.  **Wait and Verify:** Wait until the search results page is fully loaded and no new elements are shifting or rendering.
6.  **Click:** Click on the very first product result shown.
7.  **Wait and Verify:** Let the product detail page load fully and ensure the page is stable.
8.  **Click:** Click the button to add the item to your cart.
9.  **Wait and Verify:** Pause until the cart confirmation or popup has completely rendered.
10. **Click:** Close the confirmation popup and Open the cart page by clicking the cart icon in the navigation bar (besides the search icon).
11. **Wait and Verify:** Wait until the cart page is fully stable.
12. **Click:** Select the checkbox or toggle for the added item if required.
13. **Click:** Click on the 'Proceed to Checkout' button.
14. **Wait and Verify:** Wait until the checkout page is fully stable.
15. **Click:** Click on the 'Proceed to Pay' button.

By carefully waiting before each step, you will generate a reliable action log that will not fail on replay.
